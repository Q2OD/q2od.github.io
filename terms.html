            Caleb Media Studio provides two primary services:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Video Highlights:</strong> Filming and editing sports highlight reels for personal use, recruiting, and social media</li>
            <li><strong>Action Photography:</strong> Professional sports photography including action shots, candid moments, and portrait-style photos</li>
            <li><strong>Combo Packages:</strong> Video and photo coverage at the same event, switching between formats throughout the game</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> For combo packages, I use one camera body and switch between shooting video and photos during the event. This means the exact same moment cannot be captured in both photo and video format, but you'll get comprehensive coverage in both formats throughout the event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Services are booked on a per-event, per-athlete basis. One booking covers one athlete at one event. Team coverage or multiple athletes require separate bookings.
